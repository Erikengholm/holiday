								<p>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The leaders of the ethnically divided east Mediterranean island of Cyprus are ready to meet with the U.N. secretary-general next month to map out possible next steps toward a resumption of formal reunification talks, officials said Friday. U.N. spokesman Aleem Siddique said in a statement that the two would carry on discussions with U.N. envoy Jane Holl Lute to prepare the ground for “structured and results-oriented” negotiations leading to a peace deal “with a sense of urgency.” Siddique issued the statement after Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci held private talks for nearly four hours. Anastasiades said after the talks inside a U.N. protected area that separates the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south and the breakaway, Turkish Cypriot north that Lute’s contacts aimed at preparing a meeting with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres. The hoped-for meeting with Guterres would take place after next month’s U.N. General Assembly session in New York and would size up prospects for a resumption of peace talks, two years after they collapsed at a Swiss Alpine resort. An informal conference involving officials from Cyprus’ ‘guarantors’ Greece, Turkey and Britain would precede formal peace talks to ensure that all sides would be working toward the same goal. “We have a good climate, we have a common basis on which talks can take place, but I must admit that disagreements remain on serious matters,” Anastasiades told reporters. Numerous attempts at reaching a reunification deal over the past 45 years have gone nowhere. Cyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece and numerous attempts at clinching a peace deal since have gone nowhere. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence and keeps more than 35,000 troops in the north. Greek Cypriots are wary of any deal that would put an envisioned federated Cyprus under what they see as the direct or indirect control of Turkey. They reject Turkish Cypriot demands for a permanent Turkish troop presence and veto power on all government decisions on the federal level. Turkish Cypriots object to what they see as being relegated to junior powers in a new partnership and seek federal decision-making parity with the majority Greek Cypriots. However, Akinci said he would take a closer look at Anastasiades’ proposal to cede more power to each federated part in the running of its own affairs. Anastasiades repeated that peace talks can’t resume if Turkey doesn’t stop unlawful gas drilling in waters where Cyprus has exclusive economic rights. Turkish vessels are currently drilling for gas on either end of Cyprus in response to the Cyprus government’s own gas search within its exclusive economic zone. Turkey doesn’t recognize Cyprus as a state and says that it’s only defending its rights and those of Turkish Cypriots to the area’s energy reserves. Anastasiades repeated that a Turkish Cypriot proposal for a joint committee to manage gas drilling is a non-starter because it’s a matter for sovereign governments to decide what goes on in their territorial waters. He said Turkish Cypriots’ rights to the island’s energy reserves are assured, but that he would be willing to brief Akinci on drilling developments. Akinci said that’s not enough for Turkish Cypriots who insist on joint management, warning that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots would carry on drilling if the Greek Cypriots continue their own gas search. The Turkish Cypriot leader said he submitted a list of five additional confidence-building measures that could be implemented, including the establishment of a joint committee on sports.</p>

								<p>Imagine yourself surrounded by ancient tombs in a desertlike landscape where the only sounds are waves crashing on rocks. The Tombs of the Kings, a Unesco World Heritage Site, contains a set of well-preserved underground tombs and chambers used by residents of Nea Pafos during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. Despite the name, the tombs were not actually used by royalty; they earned the title from their grand appearance. Located 2km north of Kato Pafos, the tombs are unique in Cyprus, being heavily influenced by ancient Egyptian tradition, when it was believed that tombs for the dead should resemble houses for the living. The seven excavated tombs are scattered over a wide area; the most impressive is No 3, which has an open atrium below ground level, surrounded by columns. Other tombs have niches built into the walls where bodies were stored. Most of the tombs’ treasures have long since been spirited away by grave robbers. Pafos Buses 615 route to Coral Bay stops right outside the entrance (€1.50, 5 minutes), departing roughly every 15 minutes from the Harbour Bus Station. TOMBS OF THE KINGS IS an ancient necropolis containing numerous large tombs dating from the 4th century BCE to the 3rd century AD. The name is something of a misnomer as no kings are thought to have been buried here. The name, rather, refers to the magnificence of the tombs, which were the burial places of wealthy senior government officials and aristocrats. Many of the tombs are very elaborate with decorated walls and columns carved out of the solid rock. The site is fascinating and very important historically, dubbed a UNESCO World heritage site. A particular type of amphora was commonly buried with the dead and these ceramics always contain a stamp that allows archaeologists to date them and other items found in the same burial. Know Before You Go It is only €2.50 to enter the site. Real bargain. If it is a sunny day make sure you take water. It is just over a mile from Paphos harbour on the road which goes north towards Coral Bay.</p>

								<p>Perhaps the sector that was hit the hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns was the tourism industry. The shutdowns of borders, the grounding of flights, the imposition of social distancing measures and the barring of hotels and restaurants have spelt disaster for many countries’ main sources of revenue. But with many states already beginning their slow returns to normalcy, things are looking up for the tourism industry – and some countries want to be prepared to take in the first tourists who are ready to brave the outside world after the end of the lockdowns. <u>A new strategy for Cyprus</u> Last week, the Cypriot Ministry of Tourism presented its first draft of a flexible tourism action plan that is meant to pull the sector away from the brink and aid its recovery from the ongoing crisis. The ministry’s hope is that Cyprus will see its first tourists begin arriving sometime in July and is acting accordingly. Firstly, it aims to re-establish fruitful cooperation and dialogue with airline companies and travel agencies starting the first days after the Easter holidays. After that, at some point in May, it will begin providing funding to the country’s cultural institutions. The ministry’s first goal in getting the tourism industry back on track is the promotion of domestic tourism – more specifically to the island’s more remote, rural and mountainous areas, rather than the traditional beaches and seaside resorts. While it is currently too early to talk about concrete numbers, the ministry believes that the Cypriot tourism industry will manage to recover in three years time, should said recovery begin in 2020. Nonetheless, the nature of the newly-adopted emergency action plan allows for authorities to quickly shift gears and priorities – thereby adapting to the rapidly shifting and changing circumstances that the ongoing crisis entails. Such an approach, combined with the adoption of new methods of promotion and management, might allow Cyprus’s tourism industry to truly recover in no time.</p>
